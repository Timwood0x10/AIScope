# AIScope

> Making AI less mysterious · 让 AI 没那么神秘

An interactive AI learning platform — a visualization project ported from [Timwood0x10's personal notes](https://github.com/Timwood0x10?tab=repositories).

## Project Overview

**AIScope** is a pure-frontend interactive project. The goal is to demystify the fundamentals of AI — self-attention, RAG, Agents, math foundations, **etc**. — through visualizations and mini-games, so that even beginners can "learn by playing".

The content is extracted from **my personal notes** (deep learning notes, mathematics notes, **etc**.). I pulled the essential points out and turned them into interactive visualizations and games, instead of leaving them as pages of dry formulas.

### Relationship with the notes repositories

- **Notes repositories**：<https://github.com/Timwood0x10?tab=repositories>
- **This project is NOT a mirror of the notes.** AIScope is a standalone React / Vite project that turns notes into interactive / visual components.
- **The notes remain the primary learning material**: if you want to dive deep into the theory, please read the original notes. AIScope is the "visualization layer" on top of them.

### About the Agent section

- 🚧 **The Agent module is NOT live yet.**
- The "Agent Building" menu entry on the page is currently a **placeholder**.
- The production-ready Agent module will be disassembled from **my self-built Go multi-agent framework [GoAgentX (improve branch)](https://github.com/Timwood0x10/GoAgentX/tree/improve)**, and used here as a learning reference.
- **GoAgentX is NOT a wrapper or mimic of LangChain / LlamaIndex / AutoGen / similar tools.** It is an engineering-level re-architecture grounded in my own design of how agents should be modeled. Core design points:
  - **Mutable DAG workflow engine (MutableDAG + DynamicExecutor)**：runtime node/edge mutation, hot paths complete under 1 µs.
  - **6-step memory distillation pipeline**：extract experiences → classify → score → de-noise → conflict resolution → capacity limit; with Session / Task / Distilled three memory tiers, backed by pgvector for semantic retrieval.
  - **AHP (Agent Hosting Protocol) — a custom inter-agent communication protocol**：structured inter-agent messaging, heartbeat monitoring, dead-letter queue (DLQ), progress tracking.
  - **Leader / Sub architecture with Leader Failover**：checkpoint-based recovery. The supervisor detects when a leader goes down, recovers from the last checkpoint, and reassigns work to available sub-agents.
  - **Event Sourcing Runtime**：17 event types covering agent lifecycle / tasks / sessions / workflows / failover; dual-dimension recovery via EventStore (operational) + MemoryStore (cognitive).
  - **Human-in-the-Loop**：any step can attach an `InterruptConfig` to pause execution and wait for human approval; InterruptStore handles crash recovery of pending approvals.
  - **Pluggable vector storage layer**：unified Vector Store interface with PostgreSQL+pgvector / Qdrant / Milvus / SQLite / in-memory implementations.
  - **MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration**：JSON-RPC 2.0 messaging, with Stdio and SSE transport support.
  - **Observability**：WebSocket real-time dashboard, Flight Recorder decision logging, Agent Genealogy lineage tracking.
  - **Chaos engineering (Arena framework)**：built-in fault injection for process_kill / network_partition / latency_spike / kill_orchestrator; 32 benchmarks, 2573 tests passing with `-race`.
- I will first extract GoAgentX's core modules (workflow engine / memory distillation / AHP protocol / leader failover / event-sourcing runtime) into standalone, teachable sub-modules, and then merge them into AIScope incrementally.
- If this homegrown architecture interests you, head straight to the [GoAgentX improve branch](https://github.com/Timwood0x10/GoAgentX/tree/improve) for the full-featured source. AIScope will publish the `v1.x` Agent tutorials once the GoAgentX core stabilizes.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project is pure frontend and can be directly deployed to GitHub Pages：

1. Push the contents of this `AIScope/` folder to a standalone GitHub repository.
2. Go to `Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source` and select **GitHub Actions**.
3. The project ships with `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` out of the box — every push to `main` triggers an automated build & deploy.
4. `vite.config.ts` uses `base: process.env.VITE_BASE_PATH || '/'`, and the GitHub Action sets `VITE_BASE_PATH: /<repo-name>/`, so sub-path deployment won't cause 404s.

> If you name the repository something else, `VITE_BASE_PATH` automatically picks up `${{ github.event.repository.name }}`, so no manual change is needed.

### Local development

```bash
cd AIScope
npm install
npm run dev        # start the dev server
npm run build      # production build
npm run preview    # preview the dist locally
```
